# Southeast Asia Travel Money Guide: Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines

Southeast Asia remains one of the most popular travel regions in the world, offering incredible food, stunning landscapes, rich culture, and remarkable value for money. But navigating the currencies and payment systems in Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines can be confusing for first-time visitors. Each country has its own customs, exchange rate quirks, and money traps to watch out for.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about handling money in these three popular destinations, so you can focus on enjoying your trip instead of worrying about getting ripped off.

## Thailand: The Thai Baht (THB)

### Currency Basics

The Thai baht is one of Southeast Asia's most stable currencies. It is divided into 100 satang, though satang coins are rarely used in daily transactions.

**Common denominations**:
- Bills: 20 (green), 50 (blue), 100 (red), 500 (purple), 1000 (brown/gray)
- Coins: 1, 2, 5, 10 baht

**Rough reference rate**: 1 USD is typically between 33-37 THB (check current rates before your trip).

### Where to Exchange Money

Thailand offers some of the best exchange rates in Southeast Asia, but the rates vary significantly by provider:

- **SuperRich and Vasu Exchange** (Bangkok): Consistently offer the best rates in the country. The green SuperRich (SuperRich Thailand) and the orange SuperRich (SuperRich 1965) are different companies but both offer excellent rates. Located in central Bangkok areas and some malls.
- **Bank exchange counters**: Decent rates, especially at larger branches. Bangkok Bank and Kasikornbank are widely available.
- **Airport exchange booths**: Rates are worse than city options but not terrible in Thailand. Exchange a small amount for transport to the city, then use a better provider.
- **Hotel exchanges**: Avoid these. Markups of 5-10% are common.

### Card vs Cash in Thailand

Thailand is increasingly card-friendly in cities, but cash remains essential:

- **Bangkok**: Major stores, malls, restaurants, and hotels accept cards. Street food, taxis, and small shops are cash-only.
- **Chiang Mai**: Similar to Bangkok but slightly more cash-dependent.
- **Islands and beaches**: Much more cash-dependent. ATMs are available but may have surcharges. Bring enough cash for a few days at remote beach destinations.
- **Night markets**: Cash only, always.

### ATM Tips for Thailand

Thai ATMs charge a **flat fee of 220 baht** (roughly $6-7) per withdrawal for international cards, on top of whatever your home bank charges. This is one of the highest ATM fees in Southeast Asia.

To minimize costs:
- Withdraw the maximum amount each time (usually 20,000-30,000 baht)
- Use bank-owned ATMs (yellow Krungsri, green Kasikornbank, blue Bangkok Bank)
- **Always decline the ATM's offer to convert to your home currency** (Dynamic Currency Conversion adds another 3-5%)

### Thailand Money Tips

- The Thai royal family appears on all banknotes. Treat Thai currency with respect. Never step on a dropped bill (it has the King's image) as this is considered highly disrespectful.
- Bargaining is expected at markets but not in malls or restaurants with fixed prices.
- Tipping is not mandatory but appreciated. Round up taxi fares and leave 20-50 baht at sit-down restaurants.

## Vietnam: The Vietnamese Dong (VND)

### Currency Basics

Vietnam's dong can be disorienting for visitors because of the large numbers involved. You will regularly handle transactions in the hundreds of thousands or millions.

**Common denominations**:
- Polymer bills: 10,000; 20,000; 50,000; 100,000; 200,000; 500,000 VND
- Older cotton bills and coins exist but are rarely used

**Rough reference rate**: 1 USD is typically between 24,000-25,500 VND.

### Quick Mental Math

The easiest mental conversion trick: **divide by 25,000 to get approximate USD value**.
- 100,000 VND is roughly $4
- 500,000 VND is roughly $20
- 1,000,000 VND is roughly $40

### Where to Exchange Money

- **Gold shops and jewelry stores**: Surprisingly, these offer the best exchange rates in Vietnam. They are licensed money changers and are found throughout major cities.
- **Banks**: Vietcombank and BIDV offer fair rates. Banks are the safest official option.
- **Airport exchanges**: Rates are poor. Exchange just enough for a taxi or Grab ride to the city.
- **Hotels**: Rates vary widely. Some are reasonable; many are not.
- **Street money changers**: Exist in tourist areas but carry counterfeiting and scam risks. Use at your own risk.

### Card vs Cash in Vietnam

Vietnam is rapidly modernizing its payment infrastructure, but cash is still king in most situations:

- **Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi**: International restaurants, hotels, and larger shops accept cards. QR code payments are increasingly common at local businesses.
- **Smaller cities and rural areas**: Almost entirely cash-based.
- **Markets and street food**: Cash only, everywhere.
- **Grab (ride-hailing)**: Accepts cash and card payments.

### ATM Tips for Vietnam

- ATM fees vary by bank: **Vietcombank, BIDV, and Agribank** tend to charge 22,000-33,000 VND per withdrawal
- Maximum withdrawal per transaction is often **2,000,000-3,000,000 VND** (about $80-120), frustratingly low
- Some ATMs allow up to 5,000,000 VND; **Citibank and HSBC ATMs** (in major cities) often have higher limits
- Always decline the currency conversion offer

### Vietnam Money Tips

- Be very careful with denominations. The 20,000 VND and 500,000 VND notes are similar in size and color. Count your change carefully.
- When receiving change at shops, count bills immediately. Short-changing tourists is not uncommon.
- Bargaining is expected at markets. Start at 40-50% of the asking price and negotiate from there.
- Many tourist-area restaurants quote prices in thousands (a dish listed as "85" means 85,000 VND).
- USD is sometimes accepted at tourist businesses, but the exchange rate applied will be unfavorable. Always pay in dong for the best value.

## The Philippines: The Philippine Peso (PHP)

### Currency Basics

The Philippine peso (or piso) is a moderately stable Southeast Asian currency. It is divided into 100 centavos, though centavo coins have little practical use.

**Common denominations**:
- Bills: 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 PHP
- Coins: 1, 5, 10, 20 PHP

**Rough reference rate**: 1 USD is typically between 55-58 PHP.

### Where to Exchange Money

- **SM malls and Ayala malls**: Licensed money changers inside major shopping malls consistently offer the best rates. Look for Sanry's, Czarina, or other established changers.
- **Banks**: BDO, BPI, and Metrobank offer fair rates but may be slower.
- **Airport exchanges**: Manila's NAIA airport exchanges are notoriously poor. Exchange the absolute minimum.
- **Hotels**: Rates are generally unfavorable.

### Card vs Cash in the Philippines

The Philippines has a more mixed payment landscape:

- **Manila (Makati, BGC, Ortigas)**: Cards widely accepted at malls, hotels, and restaurants in business districts.
- **Cebu City**: Cards accepted at major establishments, but smaller shops prefer cash.
- **Tourist islands (Boracay, Palawan, Siargao)**: Increasingly card-friendly at resorts and larger restaurants, but smaller establishments and activities are cash-only.
- **Provincial areas**: Almost entirely cash-based. Bring sufficient cash when traveling outside cities.

### ATM Tips for the Philippines

- Most Philippine ATMs charge **200-250 PHP** (about $3.50-4.50) per withdrawal
- Standard withdrawal limit is **10,000 PHP** (about $175) per transaction at most machines
- **HSBC and Citibank ATMs** allow up to 40,000 PHP per withdrawal
- BPI ATMs sometimes allow 20,000 PHP
- GCash (mobile wallet) is extremely popular locally and can be topped up at convenience stores, though setting it up as a tourist requires a local number

### Philippines Money Tips

- The Philippines is an archipelago, and ATM availability on smaller islands can be limited. Bring enough cash for your entire stay on remote islands.
- Tipping is appreciated: 10% at restaurants (check if service charge is included), 20-50 PHP for hotel porters, and rounding up for taxi drivers.
- Be cautious with taxi meters in Manila. Some drivers will try to negotiate a flat fare (usually higher). Insist on the meter or use Grab.
- GrabPay and GCash are transforming local commerce. If you can set up GCash with a local SIM, it opens many convenient payment options.

### Quick Rate Comparison Table

| Expense | Thailand (THB) | Vietnam (VND) | Philippines (PHP) |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Street food meal | 40-80 | 30,000-60,000 | 50-150 |
| Restaurant meal | 150-400 | 100,000-300,000 | 200-500 |
| Local beer | 60-100 | 15,000-30,000 | 60-100 |
| Taxi (short ride) | 60-150 | 30,000-80,000 | 80-200 |
| Budget hotel night | 500-1,200 | 300,000-700,000 | 800-2,000 |

*(Prices are approximate and vary by location)*

### Handling Multiple Currencies

If you are visiting multiple Southeast Asian countries on one trip:

- **Do not exchange between regional currencies** (e.g., baht to dong directly). The rates are terrible. Convert to USD first or use a multi-currency card.
- **Spend or exchange leftover local currency** before leaving each country. Converting small amounts of minor currencies back home is expensive.
- **Multi-currency fintech cards** are ideal for multi-country trips, as they handle the conversion automatically at good rates.

## Conclusion

Managing money in Southeast Asia is straightforward once you know the local customs and pitfalls. The key principles apply across all three countries: exchange at reputable providers (not airports or hotels), withdraw smartly from ATMs, carry cash for daily expenses, and always pay in the local currency. With a little preparation and awareness, you can stretch your travel budget significantly and avoid the common traps that cost uninformed travelers hundreds of dollars.

Enjoy the incredible food, beautiful scenery, and warm hospitality that Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines have to offer, and do it with confidence that your money is working as hard as it can for you.
