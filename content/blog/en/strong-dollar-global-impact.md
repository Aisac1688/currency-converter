## Strong Dollar Impact: How USD Strength Affects the World

When the US dollar strengthens, the ripple effects are felt in every corner of the global economy. From street vendors in Istanbul to multinational corporations in Tokyo, a rising dollar reshapes trade flows, investment decisions, and daily living costs for billions of people. Understanding these dynamics is essential for anyone who participates in the global economy, whether as a business owner, investor, traveler, or consumer.

## Why the Dollar Matters So Much

The US dollar occupies a unique position in the global financial system:

- **58% of global foreign exchange reserves** are held in dollars
- **88% of all forex transactions** involve the dollar on one side
- **Roughly 50% of international trade** is invoiced in dollars
- **Nearly 100% of commodities** (oil, gold, copper) are priced in dollars
- **$13 trillion in dollar-denominated debt** is held outside the United States

This dominance means that when the dollar moves, it is not just a bilateral exchange rate change. It is a shift in the global financial landscape.

## Impact on Emerging Markets

Emerging markets bear the brunt of dollar strength. The channels of impact are multiple and reinforcing.

### Dollar-Denominated Debt

Many emerging market governments and corporations borrow in dollars because of lower interest rates and deeper capital markets. When the dollar strengthens, the local currency cost of servicing this debt increases proportionally.

**Example:** If Turkey has $200 billion in dollar-denominated debt and the lira weakens 20% against the dollar, the effective debt burden in lira terms rises by $40 billion equivalent, even though no new debt was issued.

| Country | External Debt (% of GDP) | Dollar-Denominated Share |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Argentina | 62% | ~65% |
| Turkey | 53% | ~55% |
| South Africa | 42% | ~50% |
| Indonesia | 30% | ~45% |
| Brazil | 27% | ~40% |
| India | 19% | ~35% |

Countries with high external debt ratios and large dollar-denominated shares are the most vulnerable. Argentina and Turkey have experienced repeated currency crises partly due to this dynamic.

### Capital Outflows

A strong dollar typically coincides with rising US interest rates, which attract global capital away from emerging markets. The "taper tantrum" of 2013 and the rate-hiking cycle of 2022–2023 both triggered significant capital outflows from emerging economies.

When capital leaves:
- Local currencies weaken further
- Stock markets decline
- Bond yields rise (increasing borrowing costs)
- Central banks may be forced to raise rates to defend the currency, even if the domestic economy is weak

### Imported Inflation

Countries that import energy, food, and manufactured goods priced in dollars face higher costs when their currencies weaken. This imported inflation hits the poorest consumers hardest, as food and energy represent the largest share of their spending.

## Impact on Commodity Markets

Nearly all major commodities are priced in US dollars. A stronger dollar makes commodities more expensive for non-dollar buyers, which tends to suppress demand and push prices lower.

### The Dollar-Commodity Inverse Relationship

| Dollar Move | Typical Commodity Impact | Mechanism |
|------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Dollar up 10% | Oil down 5–15% | Non-dollar buyers reduce purchases |
| Dollar down 10% | Gold up 8–15% | Dollar alternatives become more attractive |
| Dollar up 10% | Copper down 5–10% | Industrial demand weakens in EM |
| Dollar up 10% | Agricultural commodities down 3–8% | Export competitiveness shifts |

This relationship has significant implications for commodity-exporting countries:

- **Oil exporters** (Saudi Arabia, Russia, Nigeria): Dollar strength reduces oil revenue in real terms, even if prices are nominally stable. Countries with dollar-pegged currencies face additional fiscal pressure.
- **Metal exporters** (Chile, Peru, Australia): Weaker copper and iron ore prices reduce export revenue and government tax income.
- **Agricultural exporters** (Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia): Lower commodity prices squeeze farm income and trade balances.

## Impact on Global Trade

### US Trade Deficit

A strong dollar makes US exports more expensive and imports cheaper. This tends to widen the US trade deficit:

- **US exporters** lose competitiveness: A 10% dollar appreciation can reduce export volumes by 3–5% over 12–18 months.
- **US importers** benefit from cheaper foreign goods, which keeps consumer prices lower.
- **Manufacturing employment** in the US tends to decline during periods of dollar strength.

### Trade Rebalancing Effects

For the rest of the world, a strong dollar creates the opposite effect:

- **European and Asian exporters** gain competitiveness in US and dollar-linked markets.
- **Japan** benefits significantly when the yen weakens (USD/JPY rises), as its export-heavy economy earns more in yen terms.
- **Germany** similarly benefits from euro weakness against the dollar, boosting auto and machinery exports.

### Beggar-Thy-Neighbor Dynamics

When the dollar is very strong, other countries may attempt to weaken their currencies to maintain export competitiveness. This can lead to competitive devaluation and trade tensions, as each country tries to shift the burden of adjustment to its trading partners.

## Impact on Tourism and Travel

A strong dollar has immediate, tangible effects on international travel.

### For Americans Traveling Abroad

A strong dollar is a powerful travel subsidy. When the dollar buys more foreign currency, everything abroad becomes cheaper: hotels, restaurants, shopping, and activities.

**Recent example:** In 2024, with EUR/USD near 1.03, a $5,000 European vacation bought roughly EUR 4,850 worth of goods and services. In 2021, when EUR/USD was 1.20, the same trip would have cost $5,825 for the same experiences in euros, a 16% premium.

### For International Tourists Visiting the US

Conversely, a strong dollar makes the US an expensive destination. European, Asian, and Latin American tourists find that their money buys less in the US, potentially deterring visits and reducing tourist spending.

### Tourism Industry Impact by Region

| Region | Strong Dollar Impact | Industries Affected |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Europe | More American tourists, fewer European tourists to US | Hotels, luxury retail, airlines |
| Southeast Asia | Cheaper for Americans, more tourism revenue | Hospitality, tour operators |
| Caribbean | Mixed (dollar-pegged economies less affected) | All-inclusive resorts, cruises |
| Japan | Much cheaper for Americans (yen very weak) | Tourism, retail, hospitality |
| UK | Modestly cheaper for Americans | Luxury goods, theater, dining |

## Impact on Multinational Corporations

US-headquartered multinationals with significant overseas revenue face headwinds when the dollar strengthens. Revenue earned in euros, yen, or pounds is worth less when translated back to dollars.

### Translation Effect

| Company | International Revenue Share | Impact of 10% Dollar Appreciation |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Apple | ~60% | Revenue reduced by ~6% |
| Coca-Cola | ~65% | Revenue reduced by ~6.5% |
| McDonald's | ~60% | Revenue reduced by ~6% |
| Procter & Gamble | ~55% | Revenue reduced by ~5.5% |
| Microsoft | ~50% | Revenue reduced by ~5% |

S&P 500 companies derive approximately 40% of their revenue from outside the United States. A 10% dollar appreciation reduces aggregate S&P 500 earnings by roughly 4%, all else being equal.

### Competitive Effect

Beyond translation, a strong dollar reduces the competitiveness of US goods in foreign markets. Foreign competitors can undercut US companies on price. This competitive effect can linger for years as market share is lost and supply chains adjust.

## Impact on US Consumers

For American consumers, a strong dollar is generally positive:

- **Cheaper imports**: Electronics, clothing, automobiles, and other imported goods cost less.
- **Lower inflation**: Import price declines put downward pressure on consumer prices.
- **Cheaper travel**: International vacations become more affordable.
- **Cheaper gas**: Oil prices tend to fall when the dollar rises, reducing fuel costs.

However, there are downsides:

- **Job losses**: Manufacturing and export-related employment may decline.
- **Investment returns**: International stock and bond returns are reduced when converted back to dollars.
- **Agriculture**: American farmers face lower commodity prices and reduced export competitiveness.

## Historical Dollar Cycles

The dollar moves in long cycles, typically lasting 6–8 years in each direction.

| Period | Trend | Key Driver |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1978–1985 | Strong dollar (+67%) | Volcker rate hikes, high yields |
| 1985–1995 | Weak dollar (-47%) | Plaza Accord, trade rebalancing |
| 1995–2002 | Strong dollar (+43%) | Dot-com boom, capital inflows |
| 2002–2011 | Weak dollar (-33%) | Low rates, twin deficits, gold rally |
| 2011–2017 | Strong dollar (+40%) | US recovery leads global, QE tapering |
| 2017–2021 | Weak dollar (-13%) | Low rates, COVID stimulus |
| 2021–present | Strong dollar (+15%+) | Fed hikes, US outperformance |

These cycles suggest the current strong dollar phase may have limited further upside, though cycle durations vary and timing is uncertain.

## What Can Countries Do?

Countries facing a strong dollar have several options, none of them perfect:

1. **Raise interest rates**: Attracts capital and supports the local currency, but slows domestic growth.
2. **Intervene in forex markets**: Sell dollar reserves to buy local currency. Effective short-term but expensive and unsustainable long-term.
3. **Capital controls**: Restrict outflows to prevent currency depreciation. Damages investor confidence.
4. **Diversify reserves**: Reduce dollar exposure over time. A long-term strategy with limited short-term impact.
5. **Negotiate (Plaza Accord model)**: Coordinate with the US and other major economies to weaken the dollar. Politically difficult in the current environment.

## Key Takeaways

1. A strong dollar is not just an American phenomenon. It reshapes global trade, investment flows, commodity prices, and living costs worldwide.
2. Emerging markets are the most vulnerable, especially those with high dollar-denominated debt and commodity dependence.
3. US consumers benefit from cheaper imports and travel, but US exporters and international investors face headwinds.
4. Dollar cycles typically last 6–8 years. The current strong dollar phase is mature but may persist if US economic outperformance continues.
5. Diversification across currencies remains the best defense against dollar cycle risk.
