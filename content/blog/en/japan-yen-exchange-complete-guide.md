## Japan's Unique Money Landscape

Japan presents an interesting paradox for travelers: it is one of the world's most technologically advanced nations yet remains remarkably cash-dependent. While contactless payments have grown significantly since 2020, cash remains king for a surprising number of daily transactions. Understanding Japan's money ecosystem — from yen exchange to IC transit cards — is essential for a smooth trip.

With the yen hovering around 150 JPY per USD in recent years (making Japan significantly more affordable than a decade ago), now is an excellent time to visit. This guide covers everything you need to know about managing money in Japan.

## Understanding the Japanese Yen (JPY)

### Denominations

**Coins:**

| Denomination | Appearance | Common Uses |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 yen | Lightweight aluminum | Rounding (you will accumulate many) |
| 5 yen | Brass with center hole | Considered lucky, temple offerings |
| 10 yen | Bronze | Vending machines, small purchases |
| 50 yen | Nickel with center hole | Similar to 10 yen |
| 100 yen | Nickel | Vending machines, 100-yen shops |
| 500 yen | Bi-metallic (new design 2021) | Most valuable coin (~$3.33) |

**Banknotes (new designs issued July 2024):**

| Denomination | Portrait | Approximate USD |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1,000 yen | Kitasato Shibasaburo | ~$6.67 |
| 5,000 yen | Tsuda Umeko | ~$33.33 |
| 10,000 yen | Shibusawa Eiichi | ~$66.67 |

*Based on approximate rate of 150 JPY = 1 USD*

**Note:** Both old and new design banknotes are valid and circulate together. The new notes feature upgraded anti-counterfeiting measures and 3D holographic portraits.

### Mental Math

At approximately 150 JPY to 1 USD, a quick mental shortcut is to divide by 150 or, more roughly, divide by 100 and then subtract one-third. For quick estimates, you can think of 1,000 yen as roughly $6.50-7.00.

## Japan's Cash Culture

### Why Cash Still Matters

Despite innovations like Suica cards and QR code payments, cash remains central to Japanese daily life:

- Many small restaurants and ramen shops are cash-only
- Temple and shrine entrance fees require cash
- Festival food stalls and street vendors take only cash
- Some rural ryokans (traditional inns) prefer cash
- Coin lockers at train stations require coins or IC cards
- Taxi drivers may prefer cash for smaller fares

**Rule of thumb:** Carry at least 10,000-20,000 yen ($67-133) in cash at all times, even in Tokyo.

### The Rise of Cashless Options

That said, cashless payments have grown substantially. Major chains like Lawson, FamilyMart, 7-Eleven, and most department stores accept credit cards and IC cards. Tokyo and Osaka are significantly more card-friendly than rural areas.

## Best Ways to Get Japanese Yen

### Option 1: 7-Eleven ATMs (Recommended)

Japan's 7-Eleven convenience stores have ATMs operated by Seven Bank that reliably accept international Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, Cirrus, and Plus cards. With over 21,000 7-Eleven locations across Japan, you are never far from one.

**Seven Bank ATM details:**
- Available: Most operate 24 hours (some close 12:00 AM - 5:00 AM)
- Languages: English, Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, and more
- Withdrawal limit: Up to 100,000 yen per transaction
- ATM fee: 110 yen per transaction (charged by Seven Bank)
- Your home bank may charge additional fees

**Other reliable ATM options:**
- Japan Post ATMs (post offices throughout Japan)
- Lawson ATMs (AEON Bank network)
- Citibank ATMs (limited locations in major cities)

**Important:** Most Japanese bank ATMs (MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho) do NOT accept foreign-issued cards. Stick to convenience store ATMs.

### Option 2: Currency Exchange Before Departure

Exchanging at home gives you yen in hand when you arrive, eliminating the need to find an ATM upon landing. However, exchange rates at home-country banks and exchange services are typically 2-5% worse than mid-market rates.

### Option 3: Airport Exchange in Japan

Narita, Haneda, Kansai, and other major Japanese airports have exchange counters with rates that are actually more competitive than many other countries' airports. The spread is typically 1-3% above mid-market, which is acceptable for an initial amount.

### Option 4: Travelex and Exchange Bureaus

Travelex has locations throughout Japan, including major train stations. Rates are mediocre (3-5% spread) but convenient if you need cash in a hurry.

### Option 5: Multi-Currency Cards (Best Overall Value)

Cards from Wise, Revolut, or similar services offer near mid-market rates with minimal fees. Use these for card-accepting merchants and ATM withdrawals to get the best overall exchange rate.

| Method | Typical Cost Above Mid-Market | Convenience |
|--------|------------------------------|-------------|
| Wise/Revolut card | 0.3-0.6% | High |
| 7-Eleven ATM | 110 yen + home bank fee | Very High |
| Japan airport exchange | 1-3% | High (on arrival) |
| Home country exchange | 2-5% | Medium |
| Hotel exchange | 3-8% | Low value |

## IC Cards: Your Best Friend in Japan

### What Are IC Cards?

IC (Integrated Circuit) transit cards are rechargeable smart cards used throughout Japan's public transit network and increasingly for retail purchases. The two main cards are:

- **Suica** — issued by JR East (Tokyo region)
- **ICOCA** — issued by JR West (Osaka/Kyoto region)

Both cards are interchangeable and work across Japan's major transit networks.

### Mobile Suica

Since 2023, visitors can add a Suica card directly to Apple Wallet on iPhones or Apple Watch (supported models with Japanese region capability). This eliminates the need for a physical card entirely.

**How to set up Mobile Suica:**
1. Open Apple Wallet
2. Add a transit card
3. Select Suica
4. Load an initial balance (1,000 yen minimum) via credit card

### Where IC Cards Work

- All JR trains and most private railways
- Metro and subway systems
- Most bus networks
- Convenience stores (7-Eleven, Lawson, FamilyMart)
- Vending machines
- Coin lockers
- Many restaurants and shops

### Recharging

Recharge at any train station ticket machine, convenience store, or automatically via your linked credit card (Mobile Suica only). Maximum balance is 20,000 yen.

## Practical Tips

### Tax-Free Shopping

Visitors can claim a tax refund (10% consumption tax) on purchases over 5,000 yen at participating stores. Look for "Tax-Free" signs. You will need your passport. Electronics stores like Bic Camera and Yodobashi Camera, as well as department stores, commonly offer this.

### Coin Management

Japan uses coins heavily, and you will accumulate them quickly. The 500-yen coin is valuable (about $3.33), so do not dismiss coins. Use them at vending machines, convenience stores, or donate them at temple offering boxes.

### Splitting Bills

In Japan, it is common to pay at the register rather than at the table. Splitting bills between friends is socially acceptable — simply tell the cashier how each person wants to pay.

### No Tipping

Japan has no tipping culture. Do not tip at restaurants, taxis, hotels, or for any service. Leaving money on the table may cause confusion, and staff may chase you down to return it.

## Key Takeaways

Japan's cash culture means you need to plan ahead, but the system is remarkably efficient once you understand it. Use 7-Eleven ATMs for reliable cash access, set up a Mobile Suica for seamless transit and small purchases, and carry a mix of cash and a low-fee card for the best overall currency management.
