## Why You Need a Multi-Currency Account in 2025

If you travel internationally, work with clients or employers in other countries, shop from foreign websites, or send money abroad, a multi-currency account can save you thousands of dollars per year compared to using a traditional bank.

Multi-currency accounts allow you to hold, send, receive, and spend money in multiple currencies from a single account, typically with exchange rates far better than traditional banks offer. The three dominant providers in this space are Wise, Revolut, and N26 — each with distinct strengths and trade-offs.

This guide provides a comprehensive comparison to help you choose the right one (or combination) for your needs.

## Detailed Feature Comparison

### Account Types and Pricing

| Feature | Wise | Revolut Standard | Revolut Plus | Revolut Premium | Revolut Metal | N26 Standard | N26 Smart | N26 You | N26 Metal |
|---------|------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Monthly fee | $0 | $0 | $2.99 | $9.99 | $16.99 | €0 | €4.90 | €9.90 | €16.90 |
| Physical card | ~$9 | Free | Free | Free | Metal | Free | Free | Free | Metal |
| Virtual cards | 3 free | 1 | 1 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Disposable virtual cards | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No |

### Exchange Rates

This is where the real money is saved or lost. The exchange rate determines how much you get when converting between currencies.

| Aspect | Wise | Revolut Standard | Revolut Premium | N26 Standard | N26 You/Metal |
|--------|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Base rate | Mid-market rate | Mid-market rate | Mid-market rate | ECB reference rate | ECB reference rate |
| Weekday markup | 0.35-0.6% (transparent fee) | 0% | 0% | 0% (Eurozone) | 0% (worldwide) |
| Weekend markup | Same as weekday | 1% (major), 2% (exotic) | 0% | N/A | N/A |
| Rate transparency | Exact fee shown before conversion | Fee hidden in rate on weekends | Fee hidden in rate on weekends | Rate shown at conversion | Rate shown at conversion |

**Key insight:** Wise charges a small, transparent fee on every conversion but gives you the real mid-market rate every day, including weekends. Revolut offers 0% markup on weekdays but charges 1-2% on weekends (Standard tier). For frequent converters, the total cost can be similar — it depends on when you convert.

### Currency Support

| Feature | Wise | Revolut | N26 |
|---------|------|---------|-----|
| Currencies you can hold | 40+ | 30+ | EUR only (+ GBP for UK users) |
| Currencies you can convert | 50+ | 30+ | 30+ (at point of sale) |
| Local bank details | 10+ currencies | 30+ currencies | EUR (IBAN), GBP (sort code) |

**Wise leads** in the number of currencies you can hold and the breadth of local banking details. If you need to receive payments in multiple currencies, Wise is generally the strongest option.

**Revolut** offers local bank details in more currencies overall, but some are limited to specific tiers.

**N26** holds only EUR (or GBP for UK users), converting at the point of sale when you spend in other currencies. This means you cannot hold USD, JPY, or other currencies for strategic conversion timing.

### Local Bank Details (Receive Money Like a Local)

This feature is critical for freelancers, businesses, and anyone receiving international payments:

| Currency | Wise | Revolut | N26 |
|----------|------|---------|-----|
| USD (ACH) | Yes | Yes | No |
| EUR (SEPA) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| GBP (Faster Payments) | Yes | Yes | Yes (UK) |
| AUD | Yes | Yes | No |
| CAD | Yes | Yes (Premium+) | No |
| SGD | Yes | Yes | No |
| JPY | No | No | No |
| NZD | Yes | No | No |
| HUF | Yes | Yes | No |
| TRY | Yes | Yes | No |

### ATM Withdrawals

| Feature | Wise | Revolut Standard | Revolut Premium | N26 Standard | N26 You |
|---------|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Free ATM limit | ~$200/month | $200/month | $400/month | 3-5/month (Eurozone) | 3-5/month (worldwide) |
| Fee beyond limit | 1.75% (min $0.50) | 2% | 2% | $2 per withdrawal | $0 |
| ATM operator fee reimbursement | No | No | No | No | No |

**None of these reimburse ATM operator fees.** If ATM access is your priority, Charles Schwab (US) or Fidelity (US) are better choices for unlimited fee reimbursement. For European users, using these accounts primarily for card spending (not ATM withdrawals) maximizes their value.

### International Transfers

| Feature | Wise | Revolut Standard | N26 |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----|
| Transfer speed | 1-2 business days | 1-5 business days | Via partner (Wise integration) |
| Transfer fee | Small transparent fee | Free (Revolut-to-Revolut), fee for external | Varies |
| Fee transparency | Exact cost shown upfront | Varies by route | Via Wise integration |
| Transfer limits | High (verified accounts) | Varies by tier | Varies |
| Recurring transfers | Yes | Yes | Via Wise |
| Rate lock | Yes (limited time) | No | No |

**Wise is the clear leader** for international transfers — it is literally what the company was built for. Transfer fees are transparent, speeds are fast, and the rate is always the mid-market rate plus a clear fee.

**Revolut** is good for transfers between Revolut users (free and instant) but can be slower and less transparent for external transfers.

**N26** has integrated Wise into its app for international transfers, which means N26 users get Wise's rates and transparency directly within N26.

### Additional Features

| Feature | Wise | Revolut | N26 |
|---------|------|---------|-----|
| Budgeting tools | Basic | Advanced (categories, analytics) | Spaces (sub-accounts) |
| Savings features | Interest on some currencies | Savings vaults | Spaces with rules |
| Insurance | No | Yes (Premium+) | Yes (You/Metal) |
| Crypto trading | No | Yes | Yes (via partner) |
| Stock trading | No | Yes | No |
| Cashback | No | Yes (Metal tier) | Yes (Metal tier) |
| Salary advance | No | Yes (some markets) | No |
| Junior accounts | No | Yes | No |
| Business accounts | Yes (strong) | Yes (strong) | Yes (limited) |
| Lounge access | No | Yes (Premium+, via partner) | No |

### Availability

| Region | Wise | Revolut | N26 |
|--------|------|---------|-----|
| United States | Yes | Yes | No |
| United Kingdom | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| European Economic Area | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Australia | Yes | Yes (limited) | No |
| Canada | Yes | No | No |
| Japan | Yes | No | No |
| Singapore | Yes | Yes | No |
| Brazil | Yes | No | No |
| India | Yes (send) | No | No |
| Global reach | 170+ countries | 150+ countries | 25 markets |

**Wise has the broadest global availability.** If you are outside Europe and the US, Wise may be your only option among these three.

### Customer Support

| Aspect | Wise | Revolut Standard | Revolut Premium | N26 |
|--------|------|-----------------|----------------|-----|
| In-app chat | Yes | Yes (limited) | Priority | Yes |
| Email support | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Phone support | Limited | No | Yes | No (Smart+) |
| Response time | Hours to 1 day | Hours to days | Minutes to hours | Hours to 1 day |
| Help center | Comprehensive | Good | Good | Good |

Customer support is a common complaint for all three providers, particularly Revolut's free tier, which relies on chatbot-first support that can be frustrating for complex issues.

### Security and Regulation

| Aspect | Wise | Revolut | N26 |
|--------|------|---------|-----|
| UK regulation | FCA (e-money) | FCA (banking license pending) | N/A |
| EU regulation | Licensed in Belgium | ECB-licensed (Lithuania) | Full German banking license (BaFin) |
| US regulation | FinCEN registered, state licenses | FinCEN registered | N/A |
| Deposit protection | Safeguarded (not FDIC/FSCS) | Safeguarded (not FDIC/FSCS) | Up to €100,000 (EU deposit guarantee) |
| 2FA | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Biometric login | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Card freeze | Yes (instant, in-app) | Yes (instant, in-app) | Yes (instant, in-app) |

**N26 stands out** with its full German banking license and €100,000 deposit protection under the EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme. Wise and Revolut safeguard your funds (held in segregated accounts at major banks) but do not offer the same level of deposit insurance.

## Which Account Is Best For You?

### Best for International Transfers: Wise

If you regularly send money internationally — to family, freelancers, employees, or for property payments — Wise is the clear winner. Its transparent pricing, fast transfers, and mid-market rates make it the gold standard for cross-border payments.

### Best for Daily Banking + Travel: Revolut

If you want a single app that handles daily banking, travel spending, crypto, stocks, and budgeting, Revolut offers the most features. The Premium tier ($9.99/month) is excellent value for frequent travelers.

### Best for EU Residents Who Want a Real Bank: N26

If you live in the EU and want the security of a fully licensed bank with deposit protection, clean mobile experience, and integrated international transfers (via Wise), N26 is the best choice. It is less feature-rich than Revolut but more regulated.

### Best for Freelancers and Small Businesses: Wise

Wise's business account, combined with local bank details in 10+ currencies and transparent invoicing features, makes it ideal for freelancers and small businesses with international clients.

### Best for Budget Travelers: Wise + Local ATM Account

Pair Wise for card spending (0.35-0.6% conversion) with a Charles Schwab (US) or similar account for ATM withdrawals (unlimited reimbursement). This combination provides the lowest total cost for travel.

### Best All-Around Setup: Wise + Revolut

Many experienced travelers and expats use both:
- **Wise** for receiving payments, large transfers, and holding currency
- **Revolut** for daily card spending (0% weekday markup) and its additional features
- Each serves as a backup for the other

## Migration Guide

### Switching from a Traditional Bank

If you are currently using a traditional bank for international transactions, switching to any of these three will save you money. Here is a transition plan:

1. **Week 1:** Open a Wise account (takes minutes) and order the card
2. **Week 2:** Receive the card, load funds, make a test payment
3. **Week 3:** Open Revolut or N26 as a secondary account
4. **Week 4:** Redirect recurring international payments to your new accounts
5. **Ongoing:** Keep your traditional bank for domestic use, loans, and credit history, but route all international activity through Wise/Revolut/N26

### What to Keep at Your Traditional Bank

- Domestic salary deposit
- Mortgage or loan payments
- Credit cards (for building credit history)
- Emergency savings (FDIC/FSCS insured)
- Tax-advantaged accounts (401k, ISA, etc.)

## Key Takeaways

There is no single "best" multi-currency account — it depends on where you live, what you need, and how you use your money. Wise excels at transparency and international transfers. Revolut excels at features and daily banking. N26 excels at regulatory security and simplicity within Europe. For most people with international financial needs, having both Wise and either Revolut or N26 provides the most complete coverage at minimal cost.
