## Freelancer International Payment Guide: Get Paid from Anywhere

The freelance economy is increasingly global. A designer in Portugal works for a startup in San Francisco. A developer in Nigeria builds apps for a London agency. A writer in Argentina creates content for a Singapore marketing firm. The work flows seamlessly across borders, but the money often does not. International payments remain one of the biggest pain points for freelancers, with high fees, slow transfers, and confusing tax implications. This guide covers everything you need to know to get paid efficiently from anywhere in the world.

## The True Cost of International Payments

When a client pays you internationally, the total cost includes several components that are not always transparent:

| Cost Component | Typical Range | Who Pays |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Transfer fee (sender) | $0 – $50 | Client |
| Transfer fee (receiver) | $0 – $30 | You |
| Exchange rate markup | 0.3% – 4.0% | You (hidden in the rate) |
| Intermediary bank fees | $0 – $30 | Deducted in transit |
| Withdrawal/conversion fee | 0% – 2.5% | You |
| **Total cost on $5,000** | **$15 – $350** | **Varies** |

The exchange rate markup is the largest and most hidden cost. A platform that advertises "zero fees" may add a 3% markup to the exchange rate, costing you $150 on a $5,000 payment. Always check the actual exchange rate against the mid-market rate.

## Invoicing Best Practices

### Choose Your Invoice Currency Wisely

You have three options for invoice currency:

1. **Your local currency**: The client bears the conversion risk. Good for you, but some clients resist.
2. **Client's currency**: You bear the conversion risk. Easier for the client to approve.
3. **USD or EUR**: A neutral compromise that both parties understand. Most common for international freelancing.

**Recommendation:** Invoice in USD or EUR for simplicity and because conversion costs tend to be lowest for major currencies. If your client is in a country with a volatile currency, always invoice in a major currency.

### Essential Invoice Elements for International Payments

- Your full legal name and business address
- Client's full legal name and address
- Invoice number (sequential)
- Date and payment due date
- Description of services
- Amount and currency (clearly stated)
- Payment instructions (platform, bank details, routing numbers)
- Your tax ID or VAT number (if applicable)
- Wire transfer details: IBAN, SWIFT/BIC, bank name, bank address, account holder name

### Payment Terms

| Term | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Net 15 | Payment due within 15 days | Ongoing client relationships |
| Net 30 | Payment due within 30 days | Corporate clients (standard) |
| 50% upfront, 50% on delivery | Split payment | New clients, large projects |
| Milestone-based | Payment at project milestones | Long-term projects ($5,000+) |
| Retainer (monthly) | Fixed monthly payment | Ongoing engagements |

For international clients, Net 30 is standard. Add 5–7 days for wire transfer processing time. Consider requiring upfront deposits (25–50%) for new international clients to mitigate non-payment risk.

## Tax Obligations for International Freelancers

### US-Based Freelancers

- Report all income regardless of source country on Schedule C
- Foreign income is still subject to self-employment tax (15.3%)
- No withholding required from foreign clients (unlike domestic W-9/1099 system)
- May need to report foreign bank accounts via FBAR if balances exceed $10,000
- Form 8938 (FATCA) if foreign assets exceed $50,000 ($200,000 for those living abroad)

### EU-Based Freelancers

- VAT registration may be required depending on revenue thresholds (varies by country)
- B2B services to clients outside the EU are generally VAT-exempt (reverse charge mechanism)
- B2C services may require VAT registration in the client's country
- Report all income in your annual tax return

### General Tax Tips

1. **Keep detailed records**: Log every payment received, including the date, amount, currency, exchange rate at receipt, and exchange rate at conversion.
2. **Track exchange rates**: Currency gains (receiving $1,000 when USD/EUR is 1.10, converting when it is 1.05) may be taxable.
3. **Consider a tax professional**: International freelance income creates complexity that generic tax software may not handle well.
4. **Set aside 25–35% for taxes**: The exact percentage depends on your jurisdiction and total income, but this range covers most developed countries' combined income and self-employment taxes.

## Optimizing Your Payment Setup

### Strategy 1: The Multi-Currency Wallet

Hold received payments in the client's currency using Wise or Payoneer. Convert to your local currency only when the exchange rate is favorable or when you need the funds.

**Example:** You receive $5,000 from a US client. Instead of converting immediately, you hold USD in your Wise account. Two months later, the dollar has strengthened 3% against your home currency. You convert and gain an extra $150.

### Strategy 2: The Local Account Approach

Use Wise or Payoneer to get local bank details in your clients' countries. A US client can pay you via ACH (domestic US transfer) instead of an international wire, eliminating their sending fees and reducing your receiving costs.

**Wise local details available for:**
- USD (ACH routing number + account number)
- EUR (IBAN in Belgium)
- GBP (UK sort code + account number)
- AUD (BSB + account number)
- And more

### Strategy 3: The Batch Conversion

Instead of converting each payment individually, accumulate payments in a foreign currency and convert in a single batch. This reduces the number of conversion fees and allows you to pick a favorable rate.

### Strategy 4: The Currency Diversification

If you have expenses in multiple currencies (e.g., software subscriptions in USD, rent in EUR, savings in GBP), route payments accordingly to avoid unnecessary conversions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Accepting PayPal for large payments**: On a $5,000 payment, PayPal's fees can exceed $300. Use Wise instead and save $270+.
2. **Not specifying payment method upfront**: Agree on the payment method before starting work. Include it in your contract.
3. **Ignoring exchange rate timing**: Converting $50,000 in annual income at bad rates can cost $500–$1,500 per year compared to converting at the mid-market rate.
4. **Failing to report foreign accounts**: FBAR and FATCA violations carry severe penalties (up to $12,909 per account per year for non-willful violations in the US).
5. **Not having a backup payment method**: Platform outages and account freezes happen. Always have at least two payment methods set up with each client.

## The Bottom Line

International payment optimization can save a full-time freelancer $1,000–$5,000 per year compared to using default bank or PayPal transfers. The key steps are: use a cost-effective platform (Wise is the default recommendation), invoice in major currencies, hold multi-currency balances strategically, and stay compliant with tax reporting requirements.
