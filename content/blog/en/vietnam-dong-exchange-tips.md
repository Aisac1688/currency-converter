## Navigating Vietnam's Currency

Vietnam is one of Southeast Asia's most rewarding travel destinations, combining stunning landscapes, rich history, and some of the best street food on the planet — all at remarkably affordable prices. However, the Vietnamese Dong (VND) can initially confuse travelers with its large denominations and multiple zeros.

Understanding how VND works, where to exchange it, and what things cost will help you avoid overpaying and make the most of Vietnam's extraordinary value.

## Understanding the Vietnamese Dong (VND)

### The Big Numbers

The Vietnamese Dong is one of the world's lowest-valued currencies against the US dollar, with an approximate rate of 25,000 VND = 1 USD. This means everyday purchases involve numbers in the tens or hundreds of thousands, and even modest hotel bills run into the millions.

**Quick mental math shortcuts:**
- Remove four zeros and divide by 2.5 (for USD)
- Or simply drop four zeros and divide by 2 for a rough estimate
- 100,000 VND is approximately $4 USD
- 1,000,000 VND is approximately $40 USD

### Denominations

**Polymer Banknotes (most common):**

| Denomination | Color | Approximate USD |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| 10,000 VND | Yellow | $0.40 |
| 20,000 VND | Blue | $0.80 |
| 50,000 VND | Pink/Red | $2.00 |
| 100,000 VND | Green | $4.00 |
| 200,000 VND | Brown/Red | $8.00 |
| 500,000 VND | Blue/Green | $20.00 |

**Important warning:** The 20,000 VND and 500,000 VND notes look somewhat similar in poor lighting. Always double-check large notes before accepting them as change, and be careful not to hand over a 500,000 note when you mean to give 20,000.

### Coins and Cotton Notes

Coins (200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 VND) and older cotton banknotes exist but are rarely encountered. Most transactions use the polymer notes listed above.

## Where and How to Exchange Money

### ATMs (Most Convenient)

ATMs are widely available in Vietnamese cities and towns. Most machines dispense 500,000 and 200,000 VND notes.

**Key ATM facts:**
- Most ATMs have a per-transaction limit of 2,000,000-3,000,000 VND ($80-120)
- Some banks allow up to 5,000,000 VND per withdrawal
- Vietnamese bank ATM fees range from 22,000-55,000 VND ($0.90-2.20) per transaction
- Your home bank may charge additional fees (typically $3-5)

**Best ATMs for foreign cards:**

| Bank | ATM Fee | Max Withdrawal | Notes |
|------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Vietcombank | 22,000 VND | 2,000,000 VND | Lowest local fee |
| BIDV | 22,000 VND | 3,000,000 VND | Higher limit available |
| Techcombank | 33,000 VND | 2,000,000 VND | Widely available |
| VP Bank | 22,000 VND | 5,000,000 VND | Highest per-transaction limit |
| Citibank | 0 VND | 8,000,000 VND | Only in HCMC, Hanoi |

**Pro tip:** Always decline the DCC offer when the ATM asks if you want to convert to your home currency. Select VND to get the better rate from your own bank.

### Gold Shops and Jewelry Stores

In Vietnam, gold shops often double as currency exchange offices and can offer excellent rates — sometimes better than banks. This is a legitimate and common practice in Vietnam. Look for gold shops displaying exchange rate boards near tourist areas in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.

### Banks

Vietnamese banks exchange foreign currency with reasonable rates and low commissions. Vietcombank and BIDV are reliable choices. Note that you will need your passport for bank exchanges.

### Airport Exchange

Tan Son Nhat (Ho Chi Minh City) and Noi Bai (Hanoi) airports have exchange counters with mediocre rates, typically 2-4% below mid-market. Exchange only enough for your taxi or Grab ride to the city (200,000-300,000 VND should suffice).

## Card Payments in Vietnam

### Growing but Limited

Card acceptance is growing in Vietnam but remains inconsistent outside of major tourist infrastructure:

**Cards accepted:** Hotels, upscale restaurants, major shopping malls, tourist-oriented businesses, Grab
**Cash only:** Street food vendors, local markets, most local restaurants, small shops, motorbike rentals, many tourist attractions

Plan on using cash for 60-70% of your transactions in Vietnam, even in major cities.

### Grab and Digital Payments

Grab is essential for transportation in Vietnam. Link an international credit card for cashless rides. Grab is available in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Da Nang, and most tourist cities.

## Practical Money Tips for Vietnam

### Counting Large Sums

When dealing with millions of VND, take your time counting. Vietnamese vendors are generally honest, but mistakes happen with so many zeros involved. Count your change carefully, and do not feel rushed.

### Keep Small Bills Accessible

Street vendors and motorbike taxi drivers often cannot break large notes. Keep a separate stash of smaller denominations (10,000-50,000 VND) readily accessible for small purchases.

### Bargaining

Bargaining is expected in markets and with street vendors. In tourist-heavy areas like Ben Thanh Market (HCMC) or the Old Quarter (Hanoi), initial asking prices may be 2-5 times the fair price. Start at 40-50% of the asking price and negotiate from there.

Bargaining is NOT appropriate at restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, or any shop with fixed prices displayed.

### US Dollars in Vietnam

While some hotels and tour operators quote prices in USD, the Vietnamese Dong is the only legal tender. Paying in USD often results in a poor exchange rate applied by the merchant. Always pay in VND when possible.

### Beware of Counterfeit Notes

Counterfeit VND, particularly the 500,000 note, does circulate. Polymer notes have security features including a transparent window and raised printing. When receiving large notes, especially from informal exchange sources, check these features.

### Money Belts and Safety

Vietnam is generally safe, but petty theft (especially bag snatching from motorbikes) does occur in cities. Use a money belt or hidden pouch for large amounts of cash, and keep your daily spending money separate.

## Pre-Trip Money Checklist

1. **Get a travel debit card** with low foreign transaction fees
2. **Download Grab** and link your card before arrival
3. **Practice the mental math** — removing four zeros and dividing by 2.5
4. **Bring crisp, new USD bills** as backup (torn or old bills may be refused)
5. **Notify your bank** of your travel dates
6. **Carry a small calculator or use your phone** until you are comfortable with VND

## Summary

Vietnam delivers incredible value for travelers, with world-class food for under $2 and comfortable accommodation for under $30 per night. The key to maximizing your budget is using ATMs strategically to minimize fees, carrying adequate cash for the many cash-only situations, and being comfortable with the large numbers that VND transactions involve.
