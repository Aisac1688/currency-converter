Navigating the world of currency exchange can feel overwhelming, especially when you encounter unfamiliar terminology. Whether you are exchanging money for travel, sending remittances to family, or simply trying to understand financial news, knowing the key terms used in foreign exchange makes the process much less intimidating.

This comprehensive glossary covers the most important currency exchange terms from A to Z, explained in plain language that anyone can understand.

## A

### Appreciation

When a currency increases in value relative to another currency. For example, if the euro goes from $1.05 to $1.10, the euro has appreciated against the US dollar. Appreciation means your currency buys more foreign currency, which is good news if you are planning to exchange or travel abroad.

### Ask Price (Offer Price)

The price at which a dealer or exchange service will sell a currency to you. This is always higher than the bid price. When you are buying foreign currency, you pay the ask price.

### Arbitrage

The practice of exploiting price differences between two or more markets. In currency exchange, this means buying a currency in one market where it is cheaper and selling it in another where it is more expensive. Arbitrage opportunities are usually tiny and disappear quickly in modern, efficient markets.

## B

### Base Currency

The first currency in a currency pair. In the pair USD/EUR, USD is the base currency. Exchange rates tell you how much of the quote currency (EUR) you need to buy one unit of the base currency (USD).

### Bid Price

The price at which a dealer or exchange service will buy a currency from you. This is always lower than the ask price. When you are selling foreign currency (converting it back to your home currency), you receive the bid price.

### Bretton Woods System

The international monetary system established in 1944, which pegged most currencies to the US dollar, which was in turn convertible to gold. The system collapsed in 1971 when the US ended dollar-to-gold convertibility, leading to the modern era of floating exchange rates.

### Buy Rate

The rate at which an exchange provider will buy foreign currency from you. This is essentially the same as the bid price from the provider's perspective.

## C

### Capital Controls

Government-imposed restrictions on the flow of money into or out of a country. These controls can include limits on how much currency citizens can take abroad, restrictions on foreign investment, or requirements to convert export earnings into the local currency. China and India, among others, maintain significant capital controls.

### Central Bank

The national institution responsible for managing a country's monetary policy, controlling the money supply, and overseeing the banking system. Central banks include the Federal Reserve (US), European Central Bank (eurozone), Bank of Japan, and Bank of England.

### Cross Rate

An exchange rate between two currencies that does not involve the US dollar. For example, the EUR/JPY rate is a cross rate. In practice, cross rates are often calculated by converting through the dollar, since most currencies are primarily traded against the USD.

### Currency Pair

Two currencies quoted against each other, such as USD/JPY or EUR/GBP. The first currency is the base currency, and the second is the quote currency. The exchange rate tells you how much of the quote currency equals one unit of the base currency.

### Currency Peg

A policy in which a country fixes its exchange rate to another currency, typically the US dollar or euro. Hong Kong's peg to the USD and Denmark's peg to the EUR are well-known examples.

## D

### Depreciation

When a currency decreases in value relative to another currency. If the Japanese yen goes from 140 per dollar to 150 per dollar, the yen has depreciated against the dollar. Depreciation means your currency buys less foreign currency.

### Devaluation

A deliberate downward adjustment of a currency's value by the government or central bank. This term applies specifically to currencies with fixed or managed exchange rates. It differs from depreciation, which occurs naturally through market forces.

### Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC)

A service offered at some point-of-sale terminals and ATMs abroad that converts the transaction to your home currency at the time of purchase. DCC almost always results in a worse exchange rate than letting your card issuer handle the conversion. Always decline DCC and pay in the local currency instead.

## E

### Exchange Rate

The price of one currency expressed in terms of another. For example, if the EUR/USD rate is 1.08, one euro costs 1.08 US dollars.

### Exotic Currency

A currency from a smaller or emerging market economy that is not widely traded on the forex market. Examples include the Thai baht (THB), Colombian peso (COP), and Nigerian naira (NGN). Exotic currencies typically have wider spreads and higher transaction costs than major currencies.

## F

### Fixed Exchange Rate

An exchange rate system in which the government or central bank maintains the currency at a specific value relative to another currency or basket of currencies. The central bank must actively buy and sell currencies to maintain the peg.

### Floating Exchange Rate

An exchange rate system in which the currency's value is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, without direct government intervention. Most major currencies, including the US dollar, euro, and British pound, use floating systems.

### Forex (FX)

Short for foreign exchange. Refers to the global marketplace where currencies are traded. The forex market is the largest financial market in the world, with daily turnover exceeding $7.5 trillion.

### Forward Rate

An agreed-upon exchange rate for a currency transaction that will take place at a specific date in the future. Forward contracts are used by businesses and investors to hedge against exchange rate risk. If you know you will need to exchange currency in three months, a forward contract locks in today's rate.

## G

### Gold Standard

A monetary system in which a country's currency is directly linked to a fixed quantity of gold. Most countries abandoned the gold standard in the 20th century in favor of fiat currencies.

## H

### Hard Currency

A currency that is widely accepted around the world and considered stable and reliable. The US dollar, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc are all considered hard currencies. Hard currencies are easily convertible and maintain relatively stable value.

### Hedging

A strategy used to protect against unfavorable exchange rate movements. Businesses and investors use various financial instruments (forward contracts, options, futures) to lock in exchange rates and reduce currency risk. For example, a US importer buying goods from Europe might hedge against euro appreciation to protect profit margins.

## I

### Interbank Rate

The exchange rate at which banks trade currencies with each other. This is essentially the wholesale rate and is typically the best rate available. Retail customers generally cannot access the interbank rate directly; instead, they pay a markup above it.

### Inflation

The rate at which prices for goods and services increase over time, reducing the purchasing power of a currency. High inflation generally leads to currency depreciation because each unit of currency buys less.

## L

### Liquidity

The ease with which a currency can be bought or sold without significantly affecting its price. Major currencies like the USD, EUR, and JPY are highly liquid, meaning they can be traded in large volumes with minimal impact on the exchange rate. Exotic currencies have lower liquidity and wider spreads.

## M

### Managed Float

An exchange rate system in which the currency primarily floats freely based on market forces, but the central bank occasionally intervenes to stabilize the rate or guide it in a preferred direction. Also called a "dirty float." China's renminbi operates under a managed float system.

### Mid-Market Rate

The midpoint between the bid and ask prices for a currency pair. This is considered the "true" exchange rate and is the rate displayed on financial news sites and most currency converters. It represents the fairest rate, with no markup from any provider.

### Money Supply

The total amount of money in circulation within an economy. Central banks control the money supply through various tools including interest rates and open market operations. Increasing the money supply tends to weaken a currency, while reducing it tends to strengthen it.

## O

### Offshore Currency

A version of a currency that trades outside its home country, sometimes at a different rate than the onshore version. The Chinese yuan has both an onshore (CNY) and offshore (CNH) version, with slightly different exchange rates.

## P

### Pip

The smallest standard price movement in a currency pair. For most pairs, one pip equals 0.0001 (one ten-thousandth). For pairs involving the Japanese yen, one pip equals 0.01. Pips are the standard unit for measuring exchange rate changes in forex trading.

### Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

An economic theory that suggests exchange rates should adjust so that identical goods cost the same in different countries when priced in a common currency. While PPP does not accurately predict short-term exchange rates, it provides a useful long-term benchmark. The Economist's "Big Mac Index" is a lighthearted application of PPP theory.

## Q

### Quote Currency

The second currency in a currency pair. In USD/JPY, the Japanese yen is the quote currency. The exchange rate tells you how many units of the quote currency you need to buy one unit of the base currency.

## R

### Remittance

Money sent by a person working in a foreign country to their home country, typically to support family members. Remittances represent a significant source of income for many developing nations. The World Bank estimates global remittances exceed $650 billion annually.

### Reserve Currency

A currency held in large quantities by central banks and governments worldwide as part of their foreign exchange reserves. The US dollar is the dominant reserve currency, followed by the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound. Reserve currencies are used for international trade settlement and as a store of value.

### Revaluation

An upward adjustment of a currency's value by the government or central bank. This is the opposite of devaluation and applies specifically to currencies with fixed or managed exchange rates.

## S

### Sell Rate

The rate at which an exchange provider sells foreign currency to you. This is higher than the buy rate, and the difference is the provider's profit margin.

### Soft Currency

A currency that is not widely accepted internationally and may be difficult to convert. Soft currencies tend to be from countries with unstable economies or restrictive capital controls. They often carry wider exchange rate spreads and higher conversion costs.

### Spot Rate

The current exchange rate for immediate delivery of a currency (typically settled within two business days). This is the rate you see quoted on most currency converters and financial news sites.

### Spread

The difference between the bid (buy) price and the ask (sell) price of a currency pair. The spread represents the exchange provider's profit margin on the transaction. Tighter spreads mean lower costs for the customer. Major currency pairs have the tightest spreads, while exotic pairs have wider spreads.

### SWIFT

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a messaging network used by banks worldwide to send instructions for international money transfers. SWIFT does not actually move money; it sends secure messages between banks that initiate the transfer process.

## T

### T/T Rate (Telegraphic Transfer Rate)

The exchange rate applied to wire transfers and electronic transactions between banks. The T/T rate is typically more favorable than the cash exchange rate because electronic transfers are cheaper to process than physical currency.

## V

### Volatility

The degree to which an exchange rate fluctuates over a given period. High volatility means the rate is changing rapidly and unpredictably, while low volatility indicates relative stability. Major currency pairs tend to have lower volatility than exotic pairs.

## W

### Wire Transfer

An electronic transfer of funds from one bank account to another, either domestically or internationally. International wire transfers typically use the SWIFT network and can take 2-5 business days to complete.

## Y

### Yield

The return on an investment, typically expressed as a percentage. In the context of currencies, differences in bond yields between countries are a major driver of exchange rate movements. Investors tend to buy currencies with higher yields.
