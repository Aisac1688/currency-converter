## Singapore: Expensive Reputation, Surprising Value

Singapore has a reputation as one of Asia's priciest destinations, and while luxury shopping and fine dining can certainly burn through your budget, the city-state also offers incredible value if you know where to look. World-class hawker center meals for under $4, an efficient MRT system that takes you anywhere for a few dollars, and free attractions from Gardens by the Bay's outdoor areas to stunning neighborhood walks.

The key is understanding the Singapore Dollar (SGD), exchanging money wisely, and knowing where locals spend their money versus where tourists get overcharged.

## Understanding the Singapore Dollar (SGD)

### Exchange Rate

The Singapore Dollar is one of Southeast Asia's strongest currencies, typically trading around 1.35 SGD per 1 USD. This reflects Singapore's strong economy and stable monetary policy managed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

### Denominations

**Banknotes:** $2, $5, $10, $50, $100, $1,000, $10,000 (the latter two are rarely seen)

**Coins:** 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, $1

| Note | Color | Approximate USD |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| $2 SGD | Purple | ~$1.48 |
| $5 SGD | Green | ~$3.70 |
| $10 SGD | Red | ~$7.40 |
| $50 SGD | Blue | ~$37.00 |
| $100 SGD | Orange | ~$74.00 |

**Tip:** Brunei Dollars are accepted at par (1:1) in Singapore, and vice versa, due to a currency interchangeability agreement between the two countries.

## Where to Exchange Money in Singapore

### The Mustafa Centre and Little India

For the best exchange rates in Singapore, head to the money changers in Little India, particularly around Mustafa Centre (open 24 hours). These licensed money changers consistently offer rates within 0.1-0.3% of mid-market, making them among the best in the world.

### Raffles Place and the CBD

Money changers in The Arcade at Raffles Place and the Change Alley are popular with office workers and offer similarly competitive rates. These are convenient if you are staying in the Marina Bay or CBD area.

### Comparison of Exchange Options

| Location | Typical Spread | Convenience |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Mustafa Centre / Little India | 0.1-0.3% | High (24 hours) |
| The Arcade, Raffles Place | 0.2-0.5% | High (business hours) |
| MRT station changers | 0.5-1.5% | Very High |
| Changi Airport exchange | 1-3% | Very High (on arrival) |
| Hotel exchange | 3-6% | Low value |
| Wise/Revolut card | 0.3-0.6% | Very High |

### Changi Airport

Changi Airport has multiple exchange counters. While rates are not as good as city changers, they are surprisingly competitive for an airport — typically 1-2% above mid-market. Exchanging $100-200 SGD at Changi for immediate MRT and taxi fares is perfectly reasonable.

### ATMs

ATMs from DBS, OCBC, and UOB are everywhere in Singapore. Foreign card withdrawal fees vary by your home bank. Singapore ATMs generally do not charge an additional local fee for foreign cards, but always check.

## Card Payments in Singapore

### Highly Card-Friendly

Singapore is extremely card-friendly. Visa and Mastercard are accepted virtually everywhere, and contactless payments are the norm.

**Cards accepted at:**
- All restaurants and cafes
- Hawker centers (many stalls now accept cards/NETS)
- MRT and buses (contactless bank cards work directly)
- Taxis and Grab
- Retail shops and malls
- Tourist attractions

**Where cash might be needed:**
- Some older hawker stalls
- Small neighborhood shops
- Some wet markets

### Using Your Card on Public Transit

Singapore's MRT and buses accept contactless Visa and Mastercard directly at the fare gates. Simply tap your card when entering and exiting. This means you do not necessarily need to buy a separate transit card, though an EZ-Link or SimplyGo card may offer slightly lower fares.

## Hawker Centers: Singapore's Budget Food Paradise
